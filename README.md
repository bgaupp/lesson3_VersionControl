## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control is a category of software that is used to manage the changes made to documents, software, and other collections of information over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification made to a piece of information and helps prevent overwrites of shared project files. There are 3 types of version control systems: Local, Centralized, and Distributed. Since Distributed systems create mirrored versions of repostiories with little overhead cost, they are popular among users. 
2. Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes to files. It's free open-source software that stores snapshots of file versions over time. Files in Git reside in 3 states: Committed, Modified, and Staged. Files remain in these 3 states on your local repository until you push all versions back to the remote repository that you initally cloned.
3. GitHub is one of the most popular hosts for Git repositories. Though not a direct part of the overall open source Git software, GitHub is a useful tool for Git hosting, issue tracking, and code collaboration. It's free to use, but the public has "read" access to your project files, unless you have paid for a private project account.
